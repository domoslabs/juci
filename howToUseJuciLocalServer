Step 1. Download JUCI:
	git clone git@public.inteno.se:juci <Folder to clone to>
Step 2. Checkout devel branch:
	git checkout devel
Step 3. Create a Makefile.local:
	ether copy example-Makefile.local to Makefile.local (cp example-Makefile.local Makefile.local)
	or write your own. This file should contain a list of all plugins that will be compiled when you build locally
Step 4. build JUCI:
	run "make debug"
Stemp 5. Start local server:
	This is a script that should run in the background all the time so best is to start it in its own taab.
	The box that the server should talk to needs to be at ip 192.168.1.1.
	The default port the server listens on is 3000 to change this add --port <PORT> when you start the server
	./juci-local-server [--port <PORT>]
Step 6. Open gui in browser:
	In browser go to localhost:PORT and the server will take html and js files from your bin/ directory and make all
	ubus calls etc on the box
Step 7. Make changes:
	to make changes and see them in browser just run make debug and reload the page in browser. If the change includes
	css files you have to run make clean && make debug for the changes to take affect


IMPORTANT: your box must be on 192.168.1.1 and you need to have "list origin '*'" or "list origin 'http://localhost:<port>' to lan section of owsd-config
